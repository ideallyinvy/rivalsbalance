2752,,
General,0.0.3,Damage Scaling will no longer affect Online Matches.
General,0.0.4,Jab Combos can now be cancelled into tilts on the same frame that they can be continued.
General,0.0.4,Jab 1s now cause a flinching animation to grounded opponents instead of knockback. This prevents Jab 1s from being tech-able when hitting a grounded opponent.
General,0.0.4,Neutral Respawns: Players now respawn in the center of the stage. This change will hopefully reduce respawning players from gimping opponents.
General,0.0.4,Up and Down Angles Adjusted on Left Control Stick. The input angles for both up and down have been increased. Hopefully now you will have to hold your controller at an angle closer to 45° to register an Up or Down rather than 30°.												
General,0.0.4,Fixed a bug causing players to lose their double jumps in specific scenarios. Players should retain their double jumps more consistently.
General,0.0.4,Fixed a bug that caused frame one of hitboxes to be incorrectly aligned.
General,0.0.6,Fixed a bug that was giving players permanent invincibility for their next stock if they died while air dodging.
General,0.0.7,You can no longer immediately air dodge when exiting a hitstun state to halt your momentum. Your character must return to a slow air speed before you can air dodge again.
General,0.0.7,Players can perform a neutral jump out of dash by quickly hitting the opposite direction during the jump squat frames.
General,0.0.7,Threshold for Down Hard Lowered slightly. It should be a bit easier to get Fast Falling and Dropping through platforms to trigger.
General,0.0.7,Fixed a bug that only allowed players to fastfall once per air time.
General,0.0.7,Tap Jump was updated on the keyboard controls to jump earlier.
General,0.0.7,Fixed a bug where Orcane and Maypul’s hurtbox was a pixel lower than the other characters.
General,0.0.7,Fixed some lingering hitbox issues including Maypul Neutral Air and Forsburn Back Air.
General,0.0.8,"- Automatic Smash DI: Moved to direction hold at the halfway point of hitpause, becoming truly automatic for multi-hit moves."
General,0.0.8,- Drift DI: Only affects Horizontal DI now. Hold left or right during hitstun to slow down or speed up your horizontal trajectory. Also weakened slightly in its power.
General,0.0.8,Traditional DI has been increased on attacks that cause “Tumble Hitstun”. The max DI angle from tumble attacks is now 28 degrees instead of 18 degrees. Examples of Tumble Hitstun are Kragg’s Down Special and Wrastor’s Down Special.
General,0.0.8,"Vertical Knockback Scaling has been reduced and knockback angles more accurately represent in-engine angles. To keep vertical attacks KOing around the same percent, many have had their scaling increased."
General,0.0.8,The Grounded Hitstun State (Knockdown) has been increased from 11 frames to 13 frames. This is prevent Jab 2 -> Jab 3 from being parryable when Jab 2 is Crouch Cancelled.
General,0.0.8,Techs are now invincible on the first frame of making contact with the ground.
General,0.0.8,The minimum horizontal speed to be able to air dodge after hitstun has been increased from 4 > 5.
General,0.0.8,Adjusted the logic for dropping through platforms to make them easier and more reliable. The drop is now immediately after triggering and the Hard Down Press has a 6 frame buffer instead of a 3 Frame Buffer.
General,0.0.8,Bug Fix: Players can now jump toward the left when facing right from a neutral jump squat.
General,0.0.8,Bug Fix: Hitboxes are now active on the first frame they are out instead of the second. This speeds up all attacks by 1 frame so we will be watching the balance to make sure that faster characters are not too difficult to handle now.
General,0.0.8,Developer Mode released: This setting allows players to customize the balance in their local versus or practice modes.
General,0.0.8,Added a Blastzone Data Display to the Stage Select. This will display information regarding the blastzones based on the ground level of each stage (the lowest solid ground). You can turn it off and on by pressing RB on stage select.
General,0.0.8,"Added Full Hop, Short Hop and Off options to the Controller Customization options."
General,0.0.9,Bug Fix: Dropping through platforms was always triggering a fast fall in 0.0.8. You should be able to let go of down immediately after falling now to prevent a fast fall.
General,0.0.10,Added a new mechanic called Whiff Recovery. It increases the length of a window only if an attack has missed. We have added this mechanic to multiple characters in order to reduce spamming “safe” attacks without fear of punishment.
General,0.0.10,"Extended Parry Lag base decreased from 60 > 50 Frames. It now scales up with distance between the players up to a maximum of 100 Frames. This affects Kragg Down Special and Absa Neutral Special, Forward Special and Down Special."
General,0.0.10,Tech in place recovery reduced from 8 > 4 Frames. Total time reduced from 22 > 18.
General,0.0.10,Jabs can only be immediately cancelled into tilts on hit. This is to make Jab less safe and to prevent some characters from being able to cover rolls perfectly in many situations.
General,0.0.10,Tumble DI reduced from 28 > 18. This removed followups that characters relied on and made DI inconsistent. Instead we will be addressing how difficult these setups are to trigger instead of removing them entirely.
General,0.0.10,Bug Fix: Players can no longer tech before the Flinch State.
General,0.0.10,Bug Fix Fixed a bug that prevented players from DIing Spikes toward the right.
General,0.0.10,"Dev mode's internal structure has gotten a significant overhaul. You can now edit the following attributes of most hitboxes:
SDI multiplier
Hitstun modifier
Making hits untechable
Hit effect"
General,0.0.11,Air Dodging has been adjusted to give a true horizontal when some controllers input a slightly above horizontal.
General,0.0.12,Wall Techs can now be performed even if your horizontal speed is away from the wall. This allows players to tech walls when trying to recover up the wall.
General,0.0.12,Wall Tech invincibility time increased from 5 frames to 12 frames.
General,0.0.12,"Jabs are cancellable into Tilts even on whiff again. However, you cannot reverse your Forward Tilt on whiff. You can still do that on hit though. This is to prevent players from covering rolls with jab into reverse Forward Tilt."
General,0.0.12,Fixed bugs on Merchant Port Aether version with platforms and pipes.
General,0.0.12,Developer Mode version 0.3 released: Trevor has made a huge number of adjustments and improvements to Dev Mode. You can now create new hitboxes and have much better control over attacks.
General,0.0.12,You can now enable Dev Mode in Online matches by hitting the gear in the upper left corner. You must ensure that you both have the same exact files in the dev_ver_0.3 folder to avoid desyncs.
General,0.0.12,Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the Short Hop button was causing desyncs.
General,0.12.1,Fixed a bug that allowed players to act immediately after getting hit by a jab.
General,0.12.2,You can no longer tech after hitpause when you landed an attack. You will need to be in hitstun in order to tech.
General,0.12.2,"The Keyboard Auto-Run option did not work the same online vs locally and was causing issues. Online, the hard directions would trigger from holds instead of presses. Keyboard players now must press the input like how the option was designed to work."
General,0.12.2,The Run Button when using a DPad was not functioning correctly online. It has been updated to work with both Xinput and Dinput controls.
General,0.13.0,"Projectiles now detect collision with hitboxes earlier than they detect collision with hurtboxes. This allows players to more consistently break through projectiles with attacks, since breakable projectiles will no longer trade with attacks."
General,0.13.0,"Tumble state added. Previously, if you left hitstun, you immediately went into an actionable state. This could mess up your tech, since you would air dodge instead. During tumble state, you can hold the dodge button to tech within 20 frames of impact"
General,0.13.0,Bug Fix: You can now air dodge immediately after wall-teching.
General,0.13.0,Dpad and Keyboard Autorun options now trigger run while held down instead of just on key press. This is similar to how the Keyboard Autorun worked online in past updates. This is to improve the speed of the game for players using the Autorun option.
General,0.13.1,Bug Fix: Adjusted the 1v1 Spawn Points for the Blazing Hideout.
General,0.13.1,Bug Fix: You can no longer wall jump when the Aether version of Tower of Heaven declares that you cannot touch walls from the side.
General,0.13.2,You can now B-reverse more special moves than before. The updated specials had no reason to be non-reversable.
General,0.14.0,"Drift DI is now dependent on your horizontal speed in hitstun. When moving under 5 ppf, you get the full effect of drift DI. When moving over 10 ppf, you get 1/2 of the full effect. This change increases the effectiveness of horizontal kill moves."
General,0.14.0,"Added whiff landing lag to certain aerials, which means the move will not autocancel if it misses. This mechanic serves to make certain aerials very slightly more punishable on whiff (e.g. Forsburn Dair)."
General,0.14.0,Increased the time of flinches caused by Jabs from 13 > 16 frames to ensure that more grounded Jabs into Tilts cannot be countered with a parry.
General,0.14.0,Crouch Canceling max knockback increased from 6 > 8.
General,0.14.0,Crouch Canceling Flinch Time reduced from 13 > 9.
General,0.14.0,"Attack, Special, and Strong Buffers are cleared when leaving hitstun into tumble state, requiring players to time their Combo Breaker tool instead of mashing them. (example: Zetterburn Neutral Special)"
General,0.14.0,"Shockwaves now appear when you are hit with a move that would kill you with no DI or drift DI. Previously, any move over a certain knockback value would create a shockwave."
General,0.14.0,The HUD now has visual feedback for player damage and deaths.
General,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Diagonal directional inputs are now processed the same in local and online modes. Up and down are now prioritized over left and right in online mode.
General,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Parrying an opponent's Uspecial will no longer cause them to have weird momentum shifts. This mostly affects Wrastor and Maypul.
General,0.14.1,Air dodges are no longer lost when interrupted before the invincibility frames
General,0.14.1,Controller now vibrates when a your character dies
General,0.14.1,Bug Fix: Rumble now works properly online
General,0.15.0,Parrying a projectile now allows you to cancel the parry animation with any action
General,0.15.0,Successfully parrying removes your ability to parry/roll for 30 frames (prevents accidental inputs after cancelling the parry)
General,0.15.0,"Flinch state now lasts the same duration as the hitstun of the move you were hit by (this doesn't affect much, but allows for weak moves that force flinch to have less than 13 flinch frames)"
General,0.15.0,Jab base knockback adjusted (3 > 4) for all characters except Orcane and Absa so that the flinch state is unchanged for jabs
General,0.15.0,"Every aerial autocancels all the time except for the following:
Zetter Fair: 6f lag
Orcane Uair: 8f lag
Fors Bair: 8f lag
Fors Dair: 8f lag
Maypul Fair: 8f lag
Absa Uair: 9f lag
Etalus Fair: 12f lag
Every aerial autocancels on its last 5 frames"
General,0.15.0,Whiff lag removed on everything but dash attacks (see each individual characters notes for changes)
General,0.15.0,Parrying a projectile will only give invincibility the first time it's parried
General,0.15.0,Moves that force flinch state will no longer do so if the opponent is in hitstun
General,0.15.0,"Tech roll frame data normalized across all characters: Invincible for 16 frames, vulnerable for 14 frames"
General,0.15.0,"Tech roll speeds adjusted for most characters
Zetter: 8 > 10
Orcane: 9
Wrastor: 8
Kragg: 8 > 10
Fors: 8 > 9
Maypul: 9 > 8
Absa: 8
Etalus: 9 > 11"
General,0.15.0,"The recovery frames of a tech in place are now jump-cancellable, as well as the last 5 frames (6 frames for Eta) of the recovery of tech rolls. This means after teching, you can choose to have your first actionable frame be on the ground or in the air"
General,0.15.0,"Missed tech ground friction multiplier x3 > x1.8 (makes you slide more when missing a tech, allowing for strategic missed techs to slide off platforms)"
General,0.15.0,Bug Fix: You can now tech on the first frame of tumble
General,0.15.0,Bug Fix: Trading with a clone's attack will no longer cause your next attack to reverse
General,0.15.0,Bug Fix: Parrying projectiles will now properly reset the projectile's lifetime when the projectile's owner does another attack after throwing the projectile
General,0.15.0,"Bug Fix: You can now wall tech moves with the ""untechable"" property (i.e. Absa's Dstrong)"
General,0.15.0,Bug Fix: Keyboard controls no longer detect directional hard presses 1 frame after the button was pressed
General,0.15.0,Two new CPU behaviors added to training mode: Parry and Evade
General,0.15.0,"Dev mode functionality for parries added:
Set custom parry stun frames
Set custom parry mode:
0: old parry mode (non-cancellable)
1: beta parry mode (cancellable on every hit except jabs)
2: new parry mode (cancellable on projectiles only)"
General,0.15.1,Bug fix on two moves connecting at once and the lower priority move being ignored (Kragg Down Special for example)
General,0.15.2,Projectiles that deal more than 8% can't be Crouch-Canceled.
General,0.15.2,Airdodge on R release requires the initial R press to be during tumble (buffer included). This is to prevent accidental late air dodges during the tumble state.
General,0.15.2,Aerial landing lag is never jump cancellable on whiff now. Landing lag that is less than or equal to your character's jump frames are jump cancellable on hit still. This is to make strategies like Nair spamming stronger when you are hitting than when you are whiffing.
General,0.15.2,You can now buffer Up Specials out of hitstun by holding up + special.
General,0.15.4,All Down Specials and Up Specials no longer require a hard press to B-reverse
General,0.15.4,Turnaround-B now requires a hard press within 8 frames of starting the Nspecial (helps prevent accidental reverses due to joystick recoil)
General,0.15.4,Extended parry stun changed to be less punishing at short/medium ranges but it remains the same at long ranges. This affects attacks like Absa Forward Special and Kragg Down Special.
General,0.15.4,"Training mode Updates:
Fixed DI In and DI Out options
Fine tuned Perfect DI option
Added Drift DI option
Added Show DI Lines option"
General,0.15.4,Bug Fix: Fixed a crash involving a clone teleporting into Kragg's rock
General,0.15.5,Hit Cancelling mechanic added. Specific values can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/hb1OVAA.png
General,0.15.5,Minimum parry stun for extended parry 40 > 50.
General,0.15.5,"Extended parry stun increased by 10 frames if your attack had ended before your projectile was parried. (relevant to moves like Kragg Dspecial, Etalus Fspecial, etc)"
General,0.15.5,All characters now go off ledge for the first 5 frames of their dash attacks instead of just Orcane.
General,0.15.5,Many specials have updated sound effects to stand out more from normal attacks.
General,0.15.7,Revamped Hit Effects to make them all look cooler and more impactful. Every character’s hit effects have been adjusted.
General,0.15.7,New animation on successful parry to match the increased visual feedback.
General,0.15.7,"If you are holding down, you will parry instead of roll. This works on diagonal down as well. This should be a more reliable way to parry out of grounded states like dash."
General,0.15.7,All stages have had their bottom blastzones lowered by 40 pixels to account for aerial whiff lag.
General,0.15.8,Revamped Hit Effects to make them all look cooler and more impactful. Every character’s hit effects have been adjusted.
General,0.15.8,Having Super Armor now applies a feint white outline to characters. You can see this on Kragg Forward Special and Etalus Ice Armor on Strongs and Up Special.
General,0.15.8,Fully charged strong attacks now do 1.25x knockback and 1.6x damage instead of 1.5x of both. This is to reduce some of the jankiness from fully charging strong attacks.
General,0.15.8,Air dodging out of tumble now occurs on the key press instead of release. It only occurs on release if you will hit the ground within 20 frames. This will make air dodging out of tumble feel more reliable while not preventing techs still.
General,0.15.8,"We have updated the sound effects to use a 3D sound system. Now depending on where the sound is made on screen, it will utilize stereo speakers differently."
General,0.15.9,"Hitstun duration is now slightly more dependent on weight. Lighter characters will have a few more frames of hitstun, heavier characters will have less. The change is fairly minimal, so don’t be too worried."
General,0.15.9,"ASDI  has been replaced by SSDI (Single Smash Directional Infleunce). You must now time your SSDI inputs during hitpause. You can use either the left or right stick to input a direction, but only one input is accepted per hit."
General,0.15.9,"Since SSDI is now more manual, its effectiveness has been increased from 8 > 14 pixels."
General,0.15.10,"It’s too hard to be consistent with SSDI online right now. As such, we’ve reverted back to ASDI and tweaked a few of the problem moves. We also re-evaluated some of our multi-hit attacks to make ASDI more important and to create more variety"
General,0.15.10,ASDI can now be performed with the right stick (takes precedence over the left stick)
General,0.15.10,ASDI strength is now 10 (was 8 in 0.15.8 and 14 in 0.15.9)
General,0.15.10,Fixed a bug where characters wouldn’t go into parry stun if they landed while being boosted upward
General,1.0.1,The Aethereal Gates respawn position has been moved to prevent invisible respawning on the Basic Version.
General,1.0.2,Tilt Stick up during dash performs a dash attack instead of an up strong.
General,1.0.2,Tilt Stick now works correctly with Absa’s Forward Tilt and Etalus’ Down Tilt.
General,1.0.2,Performing a neutral strong attack after rolling forward will no longer turn you around.
General,1.0.2,Frozen Fortress platform collision fixed to match the visuals.
General,1.0.2,Frozen Fortress spawn points fixed.
General,1.0.3,Tempest Peak – Platforms now indicate when they are about to move with visual cues on the air council statues. The platforms also move less often. Top blast zone reduced by 16px and side blast zones increased by 16px.
General,1.0.3,Aethereal Gates – Players now start the match further apart.
General,1.0.3,"Endless Abyss – The huge space, lack of platforms, and massive blast zones really limited approach options and caused some slow play that was uncharacteristic of Rivals. We’ve reduced the size of the stage, taking 36 pixels off the sides and 160 off the ground width."
General,1.0.3,Team Spawns Updated – Spawn points for team matches have been made more symmetrical. Teammates now also spawn on the same side of the stage so that players can no longer start in an advantageous position below their opponent.
General,1.0.3,Keyboard C Stick – Right stick buttons have been added to the keyboard controls.
General,1.0.3,Players are no longer able to be frozen when standing on ice after a successful parry of hit 1 of Etalus’ Dspecial
General,1.0.3,Fixed a parry invincibility bug discovered by Arcanine
General,1.0.3,Stage data corrected on stage select menu
General,1.0.3,"Hitboxes can now correctly hit both a rock and a pillar, instead of just one or the other"
General,1.0.3,Red team is no longer invincible to lightning on the Aether version of Tower of Heaven
General,1.0.5,Tech rolls on the stage fixed
General,1.1.2,Ori and Sein along with The Spirit Tree stage are now available! The new Spirit Tree stage comes with both a casual Aether version and competitive Basic version.
General,1.1.2,Respawn Invincibility Time – Invincibility time on respawn has been reduced from 120 frames to 90. Two seconds of invincibility was proving a bit long (especially on the smaller stages) which is why we’re reducing it to 1.5.
General,1.1.2,"Hurtbox Updates – Many animations that use the default hurtbox rectangle (jump, double jump, airdodge, walljump, hurt sprites) have been re-positioned to match the hurtboxes better in order to give more visual clarity."
General,1.1.2,Reverse Hits – Many kill moves that could reverse (sending a character the opposite way that the attack faced) have been changed to disallow this. This is a change across the board and not targeting any specific character.												
General,1.1.2,Dev Mode – Updated the properties and data for some character’s moves to bring them up to date with current gameplay.
General,1.2.0,"Parry Cooldown – Missing a parry now gives it a 20 frame cooldown. We added this to prevent people from spamming parry back to back, as the reward for landing the parry was too high in some situations (and it was frustrating to play against)."
General,1.2.0,"We’ve normalized all outward hitting moves so that the sides don’t kill off the top blastzone earlier than the top of the move. Knockback has been adjusted to keep relative power levels the same. This change effects Zetter Shine, Fors Combust and Absa Down Special."
General,1.2.0,Fixed a bug in local stage select that allowed The Spirit Tree to come up on random even if it was banned.
General,1.2.0,"Fixed a bug where you would lose your air dodge when getting hit during its startup, but only if you air dodged out of a tumble."
General,1.2.0,Fixed a game crash that happened when bashed clone explosion was parried.
General,1.2.0,Fixed a bug that stopped Kragg from destroying an opponent’s pillar in the ditto.
General,1.2.2,New tutorials – The Hitfalling tutorial has been added to the Advanced Offense section. The Drift DI tutorial has been added to the Advanced Defense section. Check these out even if you’re a veteran!
General,1.2.2,Ranno and Clairen dev mode – Simple dev mode files have been added for Ranno and Clairen.
General,1.2.2,Removed the option to turn pause off – This caused weird situations where you couldn’t exit certain modes due to having no pause menu. We think hold-to-pause is still superior for tournament play.
General,1.2.2,"Ranno and Clairen now save their random banned state – Previously, both of these characters would always reappear as available in your random bans when starting a new session."
General,1.2.2,"Projectile parry lockout – Parrying a projectile now instantly locks out your ability to parry/roll for 30 frames instead of 55 (this is a good thing). Previously, you could still be locked out from parrying again even after you lost parry invincibility."
General,1.2.3,You can no longer cancel hitpause with a walljump.
General,1.2.3,Holding left or right when starting an utilt or dtilt will force your character to face that direction.
General,1.2.3,Fixed a bug that could cause keyboard controls to take 3 extra frames to crouch.
General,1.2.3,"A pause menu has been added to replay mode. It includes options to change the game speed, toggle frame advance, show hitboxes, DI lines, toggle the HUD, and even take control of the replay. More replay options are planned for future updates as well."
General,1.2.3,(Tempest Peak) The side blastzones have been widened by 76px.
General,1.2.3,(Tempest Peak) The platforms no longer move on basic (competitive) mode.
General,1.2.3,Ranno and Clairen Stage Skins
General,1.2.4,Respawn time before you can leave the platform increased from 1.5 seconds to 2 seconds.
General,1.2.4,Unique victory screen backgrounds have been added for Ranno and Clairen.
General,1.2.4,Players can no longer buffer a reverse Dtilt or Utilt after a whiffed jab.
General,1.2.4,"Releasing left or right will no longer clear the dash buffer.
While this fixed a bug with keyboard controls, it made buffering 1 frame dash inputs almost impossible."
General,1.2.4,"Players can no longer dash during the first 3 frames of crouching.
This is a new fix made to prevent the bug that made crouching take 3 extra frames when using keyboard controls."
General,1.2.4,Assorted visual bugs (most appearing on pause) have been cleaned up.
General,1.2.4,Two Ranno tongue/stage related crashes have been fixed.
General,1.2.4,Fixed a bug with the flinch state that made flinching Kragg’s Pillar by crouch cancelling last longer than it should have.
General,1.2.4,Speed is now capped on Absa’s Uspecial when entering parry stun to prevent shenanigans:
General,1.2.5,Fixed a bug that allowed players to ASDI certain moves such as Absa’s Up Strong and jump to get out of hitstun immediately.
General,1.2.6,Buffering a walljump after an aerial attack will no longer result in a double jump.
General,1.2.6,Gameboy Wrastor slipstream is now translucent.
General,1.3.0,Wall tech can now be cancelled by a double jump or airdodge.
General,1.3.0,Wall tech invincibility has been increased from 8 frames > 12 frames.
General,1.3.0,"You can now crouch cancel multihit crouch cancellable moves like Absa upSpecial, Ranno needles, etc."
General,1.3.0,"You can no longer ASDI up/down while grounded. This was a bug that allowed people to tech grounded spike attacks, which were not supposed to be techable."
General,1.3.0,"Fixed angle flipper 8 (Absa Dspecial and Ori Charged Flame) to behave as expected when compared to angle flipper 1.
Previously it calculated the angle based on the bottom of the player’s feet instead of the center of their body, leading to a lower angle."
General,1.3.0,"Jab is no longer cancellable into strong attacks. Forsburn could cancel Fstrong into Dstrong, which was unintended and extremely powerful."
General,1.3.0,Attacks with the ‘force flinch’ property can now force flinch even if the opponent is in hitstun.
General,1.3.0,"Successful techs now reset the tech failure window, allowing you to tech two attacks in a row."
General,1.3.0,"Shortened dash attacks no longer happen when you press dash + attack on the same frame, but rather if you’re holding down on frame 1 of the attack. This makes shortened dash attacks easier to do on purpose and more difficult to do on accident."
General,1.3.0,"Hit lockout time is no longer used as the mechanic to make multi-hitbox, single-hit attacks (like Zetter fair or Ori bair). It is now only used for moves that shouldn’t be interrupted by things like Orcane bubbles, Kragg rock shards, or Elliana steam."
General,1.3.2,Trading with a move that hits inward will no longer turn you around.
General,1.3.2,Fixed a bug that prevented multihit projectiles from being crouch cancelled correctly.
General,1.3.3,Holding down during the flinch state will no longer crouch cancel unless you were previously in the crouch state.
General,1.3.3,Opponent’s speed is now capped when they’re sent into parry stun from a projectile. 
General,1.3.3,"The moves below have been fixed to work correctly when Team Attack is turned on:
Ori’s Spirit Flame
Clairen’s Plasma Field
Elliana’s Steam"
General,1.3.5,We’ve added even more movement options to Rivals this patch with the advent of moonwalking. This advanced tech is great for microspacing or when you just want to show off.
General,1.3.6,"Spirit Tree visual bug that was visible on ""ultra low"" settings has been corrected"
General,1.3.6,Moonwalking now requires a hard up/down press so that you won't accidentally do it while dash dancing
General,1.3.6,The configuration for certain Mayflash 4 port adapters has been updated
General,1.3.6,Fixed an issue with repeating textures in stage backgrounds
General,1.4.0,Moonwalk duration increased from 18 to 24.
General,1.4.0,Moonwalking is locked out for the first 2 frames of initial dash (makes keyboard/dpad moonwalking equal to joystick moonwalking).
General,1.4.0,Double jumps are no longer restored when hit within 6 frames of double jumping.
General,1.4.0,Reflecting projectiles doubles their base hitpause.
General,1.4.0,Being put into the flinch state will now restore your airdodge.
General,1.4.0,Bouncing off the ground after missing a tech will no longer restore your double jump.
General,1.4.0,"You can now parry during respawn invincibility, but you become vulnerable when doing so."
General,1.4.0,"Kill move shockwaves have been replaced.
If the move will kill with no/inward DI then you will get the standard burst effect. If the move is a guaranteed kill then you will get a 20 frame burst effect with a special background that covers the entire screen."
General,1.4.1,Your Double jump is now restored if interrupted on the very first frame; aka Double Jump Protection: 0 > 1 (was 6 before 1.4.0).
General,1.4.1,The last 5 frames of tech options can no longer be cancelled into jumpsquat.
General,1.4.1,"On hit, the last 5 frames of landing lag can now be cancelled into jumpsquat for all moves, not just moves that have the same landing lag frames as the character’s natural land frames."
General,1.4.1,Frozen players will now break free and go into prat fall when the ground under them disappears.
General,1.4.1,Bug Fix: Jumpsquat can now be cancelled into Uspecial.
General,1.4.1,"In changing the way landing lag works on hit, patch 1.4.1 unintentionally corrected a bug that lowered the landing lag of the aerials of all heavies on whiff. Multiple aerials for Elli, Etalus and Kragg and Sylv's Nair now have increased landing lag on whiff."
General,1.4.2,"Rolls, Airdodges, and Techrolls have been normalized. New framedata:

TECHROLLS: [20f invincibility – 14f recovery]"
General,1.4.2,Fixed a bug that made players get caught on ledges.

General,1.4.2,You can no longer wall-tech when first getting grabbed by Ori’s Down Special. You can still wall tech after getting thrown.

General,1.4.3,Tilt stick will no longer allow you to cancel a jab into a backward tilt.
General,1.4.3,Purple aether kill effect logic adjusted: now checks all even numbered DI angles (19 total) instead of just checking 7.
General,1.4.4,"Bug Fix: Moves with landing windows can no longer transition into the landing window while in hitpause. For attacks with landing hitboxes, they will no longer lose that hitbox when hitting with the falling hitbox on the frame right before landing."
General,1.4.5,Dev Mode updated to version 0.4 because of new hitbox properties.
General,1.4.6,Dev mode updated to 0.5 to support using full names of sound effect files instead of numbered indexes

General,1.4.7,The purple kill effect now functions correctly when below any stage floor.
General,1.4.7,Forest Floor has been made symmetrical; all side platforms have been shifted slightly so that the far left platform no longer hangs over the edge and the far right platform is now in-line with the edge rather than being slightly further into the stage.
General,1.4.9,Walljump is now restored on death.
General,1.4.9,"Characters in a state where they can’t tech can also no longer ledge cancel.
This change is to help moves like Zetterburn Down Strong link into the final hit, since it could easily force the opponent to ledge cancel the first hit."
General,1.4.9,"Airdodging upward within 4 frames of double jumping will restore your double jump (the same way that Up Special does).
This allows tap jump users to airdodge upward without wasting their double jump."
General,1.4.9,Turnaround special window length increased from 8 > 16 (Turnaround special is performed by hard-pressing backward then pressing special within this window).
General,1.4.9,Ceiling teching added.
General,1.4.9,Missing a ceiling tech will now send you downward at half of your original upward speed (previous it set your vertical speed to zero).

General,1.4.9,"Added DI assistance; if your DI direction is within 10 degrees of full inward or outward DI, it will become full-strength DI.
This change is meant to allow keyboard players and newer players to get the correct DI more easily."

General,1.4.10,"DI Assist weak/strong KB threshold changed from a constant 10KB to a linear progression from 6KB at 20 degrees to 12KB at 70 degrees
This new linear progression is a more accurate representation of what is weak/strong"
General,1.4.10,"Strong KB DI Assist removed
Overall it made stocks last longer due to players being very likely to accidentally get perfect DI on surprise kill moves. It was also harder to get half-DI with instant inward drift on moves that send at 45 degrees (very common)"
General,1.4.10,"DI Rounding threshold: 10 > 23
This is the part of DI Assist that rounds your DI to a perpendicular angle if it's within X degrees of perpendicular. A value of 23 means that you can perfectly DI every move in the game even with only 8 unique input directions"
General,1.4.10,"Spike DI Assist removed due to redundancy
If the DI Rounding threshold is 20 degrees or higher, Spike DI Assist is no longer necessary"
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Holding up while exiting hitstun will no longer buffer a double jump when tap jump is turned on
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Pets purchasable with coins will now save correctly

General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,"While watching a replay, press Y to take control of the camera. Pressing LB or RB will change the camera's movement speed."
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Dev mode replays now save correctly
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Turnaround-special window length while grounded: 16 > 8 (Prevents wavedash back Nspecials from automatically turning around)
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Hit lockout now takes the extra hitpause from the purple kill effect into account
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,"Aldor can no longer taunt while lifting off or landing. Instead, he will politely wait until he is done before taunting"
General,1.4.10 - Hotfix,"The start and back buttons can now be used to accept or decline popup messages (to make sure keyboard can always use the F2 shortcut to revert their controls, even when accept and decline keys are unbound)"
General,1.4.11,The Forest Floor now has a unique variation for 2-player matches.
General,1.4.11,Treetop Lodge now has a unique variation for 4-player matches.

General,1.4.17,DLC characters can now be spawned while playtesting.
General,1.4.17,Up and down hard press buffers are now cleared at the start of the initial dash state. This prevents unintentional moonwalks when trying to dash dance immediately after pressing down/up.
General,1.4.17,Outward hitting moves (such as SK’s War Horn) now calculate hitstun based on the actual knockback received instead of the base knockback and scaling values of the hitbox. This means that hitting with the lower angles of the move will result in less hitstun.
General,1.4.17,"When an attack hits while the attacker is already in hitpause, the new hitpause will now overwrite the previous hitpause ONLY if the new hitpause is greater than that of the previous hitpause. Previously, the attacker’s hitpause could never be overwritten."

General,1.4.22,The game should no longer crash when hovering over a replay saved from the workshop branch.
General,1.4.22,Buffering an attack after a parried jab will no longer put you in parry stun. This does not apply to anything that would cancel the jab.

General,1.4.22,Playtest room platforms raised 4px to match the average platform height.

General,1.4.24,You can now start training mode with only 1 player.
General,1.4.24,"If hitpause is interrupted by another hit, your ASDI will happen immediately. ASDI is still checked in the middle of hitpause, so you won’t be able to ASDI if hitpause is interrupted before then."
General,1.4.24,Incompatible replays will now show the version number in the replay menu.
General,1.4.24,Holding the walk button will now prevent tap jumping with the dpad/keyboard controls.
General,1.4.24,"Dashing left now behaves identically to dashing right. Previously, dashing left would override dashing right, while pivoting right would override pivoting left, leading to inconsistencies in both empty pivots and pivot babydashes."
General,1.4.25,Added angle flipper 10. This sends in the direction that the player is moving.
General,1.4.25,When set to “Run” the training mode AI will now turn around when hitting a wall.
General,1.4.25,Extended parry stun minimum value increased from 50 frames > 60 frames. Maximum value is still 100 frames.
General,1.4.25,"Spirit Tree side blastzones expanded by 32px.
Dan: This change is to decrease the extremely early KOs we are seeing off the side platforms."
General,1.4.25,"Spirit Tree top blastzone expanded by 8px.
Dan: This change is to bring Spirit Tree’s ceiling closer to other stages so it is not as contentious of a counter-pick."
General,1.4.25,Bug Fix: Aether Rock Wall pillars will no longer move while the game is paused.

Elliana,1.4.9,"Utilt will now release all heat when firing the opponent. The move’s KB scaling scales from .6 to 1.1 based on how much heat was released. When overheated, it will always count as full heat. Hold the dodge button to not lose any heat."
Elliana,1.4.9,Utilt total damage: 7 > 12.
Elliana,1.4.9,"Nair damage: 5, 6 > 6, 8."
Elliana,1.4.9,"Bair damage: 5, 8 > 7, 11."
Elliana,1.4.9,"Nspecial will now only get buffed if the fist itself hits the mine, not if only the explosion does (this was to fix a bug where shooting the mine with the fist would cause the explosion to only be buffed on its 2nd active frame)."
Elliana,1.4.9,Dspecial’s mine can no longer break Kragg’s pillar.
Elliana,1.4.9,Dying will no longer destroy mines that are currently exploding.

Elliana,1.4.13,Dspecial can no longer be detonated by Fspecial or Nspecial while they are caught in Ori’s Bash (prevents the situation where bashing Fspecial or Nspecial while stuck would allow Elliana to use Uspecial to instantly detonate the mine).
Elliana,1.4.13,The mine spawned by Dspecial is now hittable while the hitbox is active. Hitting it will cause it to fly away from the attacker with speed relative to the base knockback of the attack. Mines cannot attach to the last person to hit them.

Elliana,1.4.21,Dspecial will now correctly fall off of Forsburn’s clone when using Uspecial.
Elliana,1.4.24,Nspecial’s fist no longer detects collision with the ground/platforms on the first frame it is created. This allows it to hit a mine placed on the ground when fired from directly above.
Elliana,1.4.24,Nspecial’s fist can no longer pass through platforms.
Elliana,2.0.0,Grounded mine hitbox when activated by missile shifted upwards by 26 pixels. This prevents a mine sitting on a standard height platform from hitting players standing below it when activated.
Elliana,2.0.7.0,"Can now hover with the shorthop button. Only hovers for a short time, since holding down the shorthop button does nothin)."
Elliana,2.0.7.0,Ground friction: 1.0 > 0.65 (to buff her running parry).
Elliana,2.0.7.0,Utilting a rock while it’s being thrown by another attack will no longer crash the game.
Elliana,2.0.7.0,Uspecial’s invincibility starts immediately when she ejects from the mech (1 frame earlier than before).

Elliana,2.0.8.1,Fspecial's big missiles no longer have an offscreen indicator.
Etalus,0.13.1,Opponents who are frozen now have super armor instead of invincibility. This gives Etalus a chance to rack up more damage at low percents and gives him reason to trigger freezes at those percents.
Etalus,0.13.1,"The tech input has been extended from 30 frames into the frozen state up to 60 frames into the frozen state. Instead of lining up with the shine, players can no longer input a direction once there are cracks in the ice. "
Etalus,0.13.1,Etalus Dash Attack hitbox has been tweaked slightly and moved 5 pixels to match the visual more closely while still remaining inversely disjointed.
Etalus,0.13.1,Parrying Etalus’ Neutral Special now prevents him from getting armor.

Etalus,0.14.0,"Bair hitbox width 100 > 120 (reaches the same distance backward, but extends further forward)."
Etalus,0.14.0,"Uair separated into two separate hits. This prevents Uair from trading so favorably with other moves. On a clean hit, the move functions identically to before."
Etalus,0.14.0,Uair has a 45 frame cooldown on hit. This is to prevent linking up to 4 Uairs on an opponent frozen on a platform.

Etalus,0.15.5,Etalus armor blocks projectiles that deal less than 8 damage. Same projectiles that are countered by crouch cancelling. (Temp solution until we change armor. SOON™)
Etalus,0.15.7,Ice Armor has been reworked. It is now more beneficial to Etalus at higher percents and worth the risk to obtain.

Etalus,0.15.7,Ice Armor breaks after 50 damage is taken.
Etalus,0.15.7,Etalus always has normal friction when in Prat Land. Even if he is standing on ice. This makes edge cancelling after being parried more difficult but still possible.
Etalus,0.15.7,Added an extra hitbox to Up Tilt to better match the visual of his swipe. Has the same properties as the main hitbox.
Etalus,0.15.8,Having Super Armor now applies a feint white outline to characters. You can see this on Kragg Forward Special and Etalus Ice Armor on Strongs and Up Special.
Etalus,0.15.8,Etalus armored strong attack super armor now only starts after releasing the charge. This gives armored strongs counter play while still allowing Etalus players to make use of the armor with good timing.

Etalus,1.2.3,Armored strong attacks now have the same size hitboxes Etalus’ normal strong attacks.
Etalus,1.2.4,"Etalus Dash Attack can no longer destroy projectiles 
This attack was designed to be inversely disjointed and lose to projectiles. However in scenarios where Etalus and the projectile are moving at the right speeds, dash attack could break projectiles."

Etalus,1.4.9,"Armored Fstrong startup changed (6 pre-charge + 12 post-charge > 8 pre-charge + 9 post-charge). Makes the super armor come out later, since the armor doesn’t start until post-charge."
Etalus,1.4.9,"Armored Ustrong startup changed (6 pre-charge + 12 post-charge > 8 pre-charge + 10 post-charge). Makes the super armor come out later, since the armor doesn’t start until post-charge."

Hodan,2.1.1.1 - Hotfix,Fixed Hodan getting stuck in his Up Tilt animation in rare situations.
Hodan,2.1.1.1 - Hotfix,"Charged Up Tilt Sweatbox hitstun multiplier decreased, 1.5 -> 1.0 (The increased hitstun is supposed to make up for the low KB values on the other moves, but it lead to situations where players knocked offstage would fall further than intended)."
Hodan,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Rapid jab can now be done by holding Attack.
Hodan,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Fixed not being parry stunned when canceling jab into a tilt.

Hodan,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Removed whifflag from the down strong parry window.

Kragg,0.0.7,Pillar can no longer be destroyed by projectiles while Kragg is still in his Up Special Animation.

Kragg,0.0.8,"Defense Ball Counter: Kragg’s Side Special has only one counter – Parry. Now it has two. Kragg retains some of his horizontal knockback while in Defense Ball. At high percents, a powerful disjointed attack can knock him back enough that he cannot follow up."
Kragg,0.0.8,Kragg Rock Pull Time increased from 27 > 29 Frames.
Kragg,0.0.8,Kragg Rock Throw Times increased from 4 > 6 frames in every direction. This allows some characters to combo Kragg with a rock more easily.
Kragg,0.0.8,Bug Fix: Moving Rocks that break no longer create a solid rock for 1 frame. This should fix many of the bugs with Kragg causing players to disappear. This also prevents Kragg from regaining his double jump by breaking his own falling rock beneath him.

Kragg,0.0.9,Bug Fix: Kragg was able to be hit out of throw and lose the rock if hit during frames 4-6. He now will be hit but retain the rock.

Kragg,0.13.0,Kragg Jab 1 Endlag reduced from 17 > 13. This makes Jab a safer poke option.

Kragg,0.13.0,Kragg Back Air 7 Base .5 Scaling > 6 Base .4 Scaling. This is to allow more followups for Back Air.
Kragg,0.13.0,All Shattered Rocks will be reflected when you parry one of them.
Kragg,0.13.0,Forward Tilt will now send behind Kragg if the opponent is hit while behind Kragg. This is to reduce his easy ability to get opponents off stage.

Maypul,0.0.4,Jab 1 and 2 startup reduced from 5 frames to 3 frames.
Maypul,0.0.4,Dash Attack Horizontal Speed reduced from 14 to 12. This is to allow the move to combo into itself more appropriately and prevent it from having too large of punish range.
Maypul,0.0.4,Back Air hitboxes increased to match the visuals.
Maypul,0.0.4,Up Strong Active Frames increased from 3 to 6. Hitbox also adjusted to match her visual.
Maypul,0.0.7,Plant Camping: Maypul’s Fat Plant now goes away after 15 seconds. You can not extend this time by feeding or taunting.
Maypul,0.0.7,Fat Plant only takes 3 seeds to be fully fed now.
Maypul,0.0.7,Down Special (Plant) Recovery reduced from 16 – 14 frames.
Maypul,0.0.7,Strong Wrap base time increased from 24 frames to 30 frames.
Maypul,0.0.7,"Back Air Damage increased from 4,6 to 5,6."
Maypul,0.0.7,Neutral Air Startup Decreased from 8 frames to 6 frames.
Maypul,0.0.7,Parry active increased from 6 to 8 frames. Now all Rivals with the exception of Forsburn have the same Parry data.
Maypul,0.0.7,Sling Shot Recovery (5 Frames long) can only be cancelled when Maypul is in the air. You must wait 5 frames before doing a ground attack now.
Maypul,0.0.7,Aerial Down Special Startup increased from 10 - 13 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.7,Up Tilt hitboxes adjusted to match the visuals.
Maypul,0.0.7,Opponent Invincibility at the start of a Wrapped State removed.
Maypul,0.0.7,Bug Fix: Maypul should no longer teleport when Sling Shotting toward an opponent that dies.
Maypul,0.0.7,Bug Fix: Maypul should no longer go further during hitpause of Side Special.
Maypul,0.0.7,Fixed a bug where Orcane and Maypul’s hurtbox was a pixel lower than the other characters.
Maypul,0.0.8,Plant Camping II: Lily no longer wraps a marked opponent. Now it wraps opponents who are both marked and in hitstun.  We are trying to stop Maypul’s ability to slow a tight match down to a crawl. Now she actively has to combo into Lily or fight close to her.
Maypul,0.0.8,Fat Lily has permanence again. It will last until it wraps or a new one is planted.
Maypul,0.0.8,Skinny Lily Base Wrap Time increased from 30 > 50 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.8,Fat Lily Base Wrap Time increased from 60 > 70 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.8,Maypul’s Sling Shot has between 0 and 8 more frames of Travel Time on the way up depending on distance. It’s harder to sling upward! This is to make Sling Shot to Up Air true combo at higher percents than it does currently.
Maypul,0.0.8,Down Tilt Damage increased from 7 > 9. This gives her some reason to use it as opposed to Forward Tilt which is faster and has more range.
Maypul,0.0.8,Forward Special Scaling increased from .35 > .4. This is to address Forward Special spam at low percents.
Maypul,0.0.10,Dash Attack recovery reduced from 10 > 8. Whiff Recovery of 16 added.
Maypul,0.0.10,Forward Tilt recovery remains at 10. Whiff Recovery of 14 added.
Maypul,0.0.10,Fspecial recovery remains at 8. Whiff Recovery of 12 added but only while Maypul is on the ground. This does not affect her recovery.
Maypul,0.0.10,Aerial Fspecial Horizontal Speed reduced from 12 > 11.
Maypul,0.0.10,Fspecial Knockback angle changed from 60 > 120. This now knocks behind Maypul.
Maypul,0.0.10,Fspecial Hitstun reduced from .9x normal length to .5x normal length. Opponents can decide what to do post follow up such as jump away or aerial.
Maypul,0.0.10,All 3 of Maypul’s Strong Attacks have both been reduced in range by about 20%. Their visuals have been updated to match.
Maypul,0.0.10,Forward Strong startup reduced from 22 > 20.
Maypul,0.0.10,Down Strong startup reduced from 12 > 10.
Maypul,0.0.10,Dair aerial recovery has been increased from 8 > 12.
Maypul,0.0.10,Up Special un-marked hitbox has been extended and increased in size to match the visual.
Maypul,0.0.10,Down Tilt hitbox has been extended further toward her body to help her cover rolls.
Maypul,0.0.10,Skinny Plant base wrap time decreased from 50 > 40.
Maypul,0.0.10,Fat Plant base wrap time decreased from 70 > 50.
Maypul,0.0.10,Nair Startup 6 > 8 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.10,Dair Startup 5 > 7 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.10,Fair Startup 11 > 12 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.10,Up Air Startup 6 > 8 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.10,Tether travel time no longer increases on the way up. More time added to all slings based on travel distance.
Maypul,0.0.10,Tether grounded recovery increased from 5 > 6.
Maypul,0.0.10,Down Strong will only hit an opponent once even if they are wrapped.
Maypul,0.0.10,Down Air will no longer reflect when parried allowing your opponent to follow up how they choose.
Maypul,0.0.10,Up Strong Knockback reduced from 9 Base 1.3 Scaling to 8 Base 1.2 Scaling.
Maypul,0.0.12,Lily now wraps all marked opponents again. They no longer are required to be in hitstun.
Maypul,0.0.12,Fat Lily has been removed from the game. Maypul can still feed Lily or Taunt to extend her life time but she will no longer be fed to permanence. This is to reduce her camping ability with a Fat Lily.
Maypul,0.0.12,Parrying Maypul’s attacks now removes her Watcher’s Mark from opponents. This is to reduce the viability of spamming seeds against a marked target and opens up a way for opponents to work around Watcher’s Mark.
Maypul,0.0.12,Neutral Special seed start moved back 10 px closer to her hand to make feeding Lily up close easier.
Maypul,0.0.12,"We have changed the input for using Maypul's Up Special Uppercut while opponents are marked. Now to perform the Uppercut if your opponent is marked, you must be holding dodge during its startup frames instead of just releasing the special button early."
Maypul,0.0.12,Down Strong Startup increased from 10 > 12. Down Strong Knockback scaling increased from 1.0 > 1.1.
Maypul,0.0.12,Strong attacks no longer deal increased knockback on wrapped opponents. This is to remove the extra benefit she gets for wrapping with Lily in order to secure an earlier KO.
Maypul,0.0.12,Down Special Ground cast total frames increased from 24 > 27 Frames.
Maypul,0.0.12,Up Special Tether end location moved from 40px away from the center of her target to 46px. This moves her out of range of Orcane’s Puddleless Up Strong and Maypul’s Up Strong as guaranteed punishes for all 3 tether directions.
Maypul,0.12.1,Maypul Up Special can now perform the uppercut by holding either Attack OR Dodge during the startup frames.
Maypul,0.12.2,Opponents can no longer tech out of the wrapped state when wrapped by a wall.
Maypul,0.13.0,Lily no longer wraps marked opponents. Instead she attacks all nearby opponents. Lily goes away after attacking.
Maypul,0.13.0,Lily’s attack has 9 frames of startup and is dodgeable in the neutral. It only has 3 frames of startup if Lily’s target is in hitstun to prevent players from always being able to tech before the attack goes off.
Maypul,0.13.0,Lily knocks opponent away from her center horizontally similarly to Absa’s Cloud.
Maypul,0.13.0,Tether base travel time is 3 frames faster when your opponent is in hitstun when you trigger it and 5 frames slower when they are not in hitstun.
Maypul,0.13.0,Maypul now has 7 frames of aerial recovery on tether (same as grounded recovery) if your opponent was not in hitstun when you triggered tether.
Maypul,0.13.0,Tether travel is now projectile immune instead of entirely invincible. This is to remove its incredible power in the neutral at dodging around attacking.
Maypul,0.13.0,Up Tilt recovery remains at 12 Frames. Now has 16 frame whiff recovery.
Maypul,0.13.0,Parrying Maypul no longer removes your mark. This is because her Tether and Lily reworks do not necessitate the removal of mark currently.
Maypul,0.13.0,Maypul's neutral hurtbox was reshaped to match her visual more. Slightly thinner and slightly taller.
Maypul,0.13.0,Neutral Air Hand hitboxes slightly reduced in size. This is to reduce the ease of her tech chases.
Maypul,0.13.0,Forward Tilt Base Knockback Reduced from 7 > 6. This is to reduce how easy it is to get gimpable Rivals far off stage.
Maypul,0.13.0,"Forward Tilt, Jab 1 and Jab 2 Hitboxes reduced very slightly in size. (Around 10% reduction). This and the following two are to reduce her reliance on Jabs and Forward Tilt in the neutral."
Maypul,0.13.0,Forward Tilt Recovery increased from 10 Base 14 Whiff to 12 Base 16 Whiff.
Maypul,0.13.0,Jab Hit 1 and 2 Damage Reduced from 4 > 3.
Maypul,0.13.0,Fair - Hit frame 14-15 -> 13-14
Maypul,0.13.0,Dair - Causes Extended Parry Stun flag 0 -> 1
Maypul,0.13.0,Down Special (Aerial) - No longer projectile immune
Maypul,0.13.1,Bug Fix: Taunting while Lily is attacking will no longer cause Lily to stay active yet no longer attack.
Maypul,0.14.0,Dash Attack whiff lag 16 > 20.
Maypul,0.14.0,Nair landing lag 16 > 9.
Maypul,0.14.0,Nair autocancel frame 4 > 2.
Maypul,0.14.0,Nair hurtbox extended.
Maypul,0.14.0,Dair landing lag 5 > 7.
Maypul,0.14.0,Bair hurtbox extended.
Maypul,0.14.0,"Base wrap frames 30 > 24, wrap scaling .2 > .14."
Maypul,0.14.0,Whiff landing lag added to Nair and Dair.
Maypul,0.14.0,Jab hit 2 base knockback 4 > 5.
Maypul,0.14.0,Jab hit 2 whifflag 0 > 13.
Maypul,0.14.0,"Dtilt width 100 > 70 (reaches the same distance forward, but not as far back). This is to reduce her insane tech chasing ability."
Maypul,0.14.0,Aerial dspecial goes into special fall. To make it more consistent with Forward Special and give it some counter play when used mid combo.
Maypul,0.14.0,Plant attack active frames 3 > 1. Makes rolling to avoid the attack more consistent.
Maypul,0.14.0,Walljump now goes slightly outward instead of straight up.
Maypul,0.14.0,Uspecial Sling base increased from 4 > 6. Sling Time by distance increased slightly.
Maypul,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Removed inconsistent forward burst on jab combo.
Maypul,0.14.0,"Bug Fix: If a wall is destroyed while Maypul is clinging onto it, she will automatically walljump."
Maypul,0.14.1,Lily Lifespan: Dies on frame 563 > 803
Maypul,0.14.1,Walljump speed increased slightly
Maypul,0.15.0,"All of Maypul's aerials autocancel on the last 5 frames of the attack except for the following: 
Maypul Fair: 8 frames of landing lag"
Maypul,0.15.0,"Whiff lag removed on everything but dash attacks
Maypul ftilt: 12 recovery, 16 whiff > 14 recovery
Maypul utilt: 12 recovery, 16 whiff > 16 recovery
Maypul dattack: 8 recovery, 20 whiff > unchanged
Maypul fspecial: 8 recovery, 12 whiff > 8 recovery"
Maypul,0.15.0,Utilt hitboxes slightly reduced in size to match animation better and allow for better whiff punish opportunities
Maypul,0.15.0,Nair startup 8 > 10
Maypul,0.15.0,Nair outer hitbox active frames 7 > 5 (active window shortened by 2 frames as well so the endlag is still the same)
Maypul,0.15.0,Ustrong startup 12 > 14
Maypul,0.15.0,"Base wrap frames 24 > 34, wrap scaling .14 > .1 (Overall increases wrap time without making wrap into Ustrong guaranteed until around 100%)"
Maypul,0.15.0,Nspecial will now mark Etalus when he's armored
Maypul,0.15.0,Nspecial hitbox extended backward (for the first frame only) to prevent it from passing through opponents
Maypul,0.15.0,"Holding left or right at the beginning of Uspecial's recovery frames will give Maypul a small horizontal boost, helping her recovery a little bit after last patch's walljump change"
Maypul,0.15.0,"Uspecial input reverted to the tap/hold version. If special is held, Maypul will use the tether Uspecial. If special is tapped, Maypul will use the normal Uspecial"
Maypul,0.15.0,Uspecial will perform the tether version if the attack button is pressed any time during the startup. This is for those who want a more consistent way to buffer tether in the middle of combos
Maypul,0.15.0,"Root Dair removed. While the root was a cool attack, it didn't fit with Maypul's ""grounded rushdown"" archetype and reduced her weakness of being above opponents"
Maypul,0.15.0,"Dair replaced with a multihit drill move that knocks opponents upward and away at the end. The multihit is a very weak spike with no knockback scaling that can be escaped with downward SDI, but only if Maypul doesn't fast fall"
Maypul,0.15.0,"For those who love Maypul’s Root, give Drill a chance! We are still in Early Access so we will be assessing how both attacks fit into her kit while maintaining her unique style."
Maypul,0.15.0,Aerial Dspecial goes through platforms if down is held
Maypul,0.15.0,Aerial Dspecial no longer goes into special fall
Maypul,0.15.0,Aerial Dspecial recovery 6 > 10
Maypul,0.15.0,Lily now wraps opponents who are both marked and in hitstun. Otherwise she will do her standard attack.
Maypul,0.15.0,Bug Fix: Parrying the 2nd frame of Uspecial will no longer cause Maypul to rise extremely high in the air
Maypul,0.15.1,Maypul Up Special can now break stationary rocks.
Maypul,0.15.2,Extended parry stun changed to be less punishing at short/medium ranges but it remains the same at long ranges. (Maypul down-air)                                                                                             
Maypul,0.15.2,Maypul’s Down Air Root is back for now! The main reason to go back to the root is that we find her a bit less fun to play without the variety root gives. We have increased the end lag from 12 > 18 to make it not as powerful when maypul is very high. 
Maypul,0.15.2,Down Air Root projectile can now be destroyed by melee attacks. It is difficult to time but some hitboxes can protect players from the root before it strikes.
Maypul,0.15.2,Jab 1 startup increased from 3 to 4 frames.
Maypul,0.15.2,Maypul is no longer considered grounded while tethering through ground (prevents her from being frozen and pillar gimped mid-tether)
Maypul,0.15.5,Hit Cancelling mechanic added. Specific values can be found here: http://i.imgur.com/hb1OVAA.png
Maypul,0.15.5,Extended parry stun increased by 10 frames if your attack had ended before your projectile was parried. (Maypul down-air)
Maypul,0.15.5,Down Tilt damage 9 > 7.
Maypul,0.15.5,"Back Air damage 5, 6 > 4, 5."
Maypul,0.15.5,Neutral Air weak hit damage 5 > 4.
Maypul,0.15.5,Bug Fix: Parrying Maypul's dair no longer causes it to hurt Maypul.
Maypul,0.15.6,Bug Fix: Maypul can now use the strong button when facing right again. Sorry about that.
Maypul,0.15.6,Maypul Up Tilt recovery reduced from 16/24 to 13/20. The previous lag made up tilt too committal for the type of attack it is.
Maypul,0.15.7,Neutral Air Startup reduced from 10 to 8. This attack is important to the speed and finesse of Maypul’s combo game and just felt too slow.
Maypul,0.15.7,Up tilt active increased from 3 to 4 to line up with visual of the roots.
Maypul,0.15.7,Aerial Down Special Hitbox and Hurtbox adjusted to be less disjointed.
Maypul,0.15.7,"Fat Lily returns! Feed Lily 3 times to make her fat, making her last until she is placed again, attacks or wraps. Since you can still parry or roll to bait out Fat Lily, this should be a minor Lily buff."
Maypul,0.15.9,"Can not plant a new Lily when one already exists (as a result, Fat Lily had to be removed)."
Maypul,0.15.9,Parrying Lily’s attack now puts Lily in a stunned state for 4 seconds. Lily still disappears after being parried.
Maypul,0.15.10,Lily lifespan reduced 12 seconds > 10 seconds.
Maypul,0.15.10,Lily will attack if Maypul is in hitstun again. It was way too unpredictable to work well for the opponent.
Maypul,0.15.10,"Maypul Down Strong Hit 1 Art and Hitbox adjusted to match. Art reduced, hitbox expanded by 2 pixels."
Maypul,0.15.10,Maypul Up Strong Art and Hitbox adjusted to match. Thinner near maypul wider at the top.
Maypul,1.0.0,Maypul Root not destroyed by hitboxes. Damage 6 > 5.
Maypul,1.0.0,Maypul lower Usmash hitbox reinspect. (only 8 pixels wider)
Maypul,1.1.2,Fstrong hitbox made slightly bigger
Maypul,1.1.2,Added 2 hitboxes to Dstrong in order to match the animation better
Maypul,1.1.2,Strong attack wrap time scaling increased from .1 > .13
Maypul,1.1.2,Fair can no longer reverse
Maypul,1.2.0,"Maypul’s air friction has been increased from .05 > .06.
Maypul dies very early so this gives her a little help in making her very slightly harder to KO horizontally."
Maypul,1.2.0,Utilt recovery decreased from 13 > 10. (whiff decreased from 20 > 15)
Maypul,1.2.0,Dash attack hit 1 has been updated to more reliably link into hit 2.
Maypul,1.2.0,Uair hitbox 3 increased from 70×60 > 80×80.
Maypul,1.2.0,Nair hitbox 1 (inside hitbox) increased from 70×40 > 90×40.
Maypul,1.2.0,Fair hitbox increased from 60×80 > 80×85.
Maypul,1.2.0,Lily bite damage increased from 4 > 8.
Maypul,1.2.3,"Uspecial tether (only when appearing above your opponent) can no longer be cancelled into an attack.
There are now 7 frames of lag before you can up air. This prevents some degenerate tether combos."
Maypul,1.2.3,Uspecial can now only drop through platforms if you hit with the move.
Maypul,1.2.3,Uair angle increased from 60 > 70 degrees toward Maypul.
Maypul,1.2.4,Nair hit lockout time has been shortened to the minimum value. This is to prevent Lily from missing her attack when Maypul Nairs someone right next to her.
Maypul,1.2.4,The knockback angles for Uair 1 and 2 have been reverted back from 70 > 60.
Maypul,1.2.4,"Uair hits 1 and 2 now have double scaling only when Uair is performed after tethering. 
Our goal is to keep tether Uair good while preventing it from being 100% guaranteed. This change introduces a 50/50 on DI between tether Uair and tether Nair combos."
Maypul,1.2.5,Maypul dash attack now links as intended (i.e. is more reliable) between hit one and two.
Maypul,1.3.0,Parrying a non-projectile hit will now remove the watcher’s mark.
Maypul,1.3.0,Uair hitboxes now match the animation better (still has the same range in all 4 directions).
Maypul,1.3.0,Can no longer cancel the end of the tether animation with an Uspecial (tether Uspecial was a guaranteed combo on Etalus).
Maypul,1.3.3,"Uair hit 1 and 2 SDI modifier increased from 1 > 1.2. 
This prevents uair > tether > uair from being guaranteed which had somehow worked its way back into the game."
Maypul,1.3.5,"Forward Special now has double the endlag if it whiffs, but only if it was started on the ground (or within 32px above ground) and was not reversed."
Maypul,1.3.6,Lily has been brought to heel (will now attack when she's supposed to)
Maypul,1.4.1,Forward Air hitbox now matches animation better.
Maypul,1.4.1,Forward Special will no longer auto-reverse after reversing a tether to an opponent.
Maypul,1.4.5,Parrying ANY move now removes Watcher’s Mark.
Maypul,1.4.5,Up Special can no longer be platform-cancelled during hitpause.
Maypul,1.4.5,Wrapping an opponent with a strong attack starts a 3 frame lockout where they can’t be wrapped again. The lockout timer doesn’t start counting down until they break free from the wrap.
Maypul,1.4.5,"Non Tether Up Special now has a 1 frame hitbox before the rising hitbox that has less scaling than the rising hit. Uspecial can only be cancelled between the 2 hits.
Side effects:
Total damage: 8 > 10
Startup: 10 > 9
Hitpause increased"
Maypul,1.4.5,Bug Fix: Down Air’s root no longer moves double speed on moving platforms.
Maypul,1.4.5,Bug Fix: Down Air hurtbox fixed.
Maypul,1.4.6,Maypul Uspecial hit 1 size changed to better overlap the bottom of hitbox 2 and to reach platforms above her
Maypul,1.4.6,Taunt can no longer be turbo-cancelled
Maypul,1.4.9,Uspecial can no longer drop through platforms after being parried (in previous patches hitting another player/object at the same time as getting parried on the first frame of the attack allowed Maypul to drop through the platform and cancel the parry stun).
Maypul,1.4.9,Lily will no longer detect respawning players.
Maypul,1.4.10,Attacks that wrap will no longer create the purple kill effect.
Maypul,1.4.13,Aerial F-Special's animation is now correctly lined up with her hurtbox. This is a visual change only.
Maypul,1.4.14,Fair hit lockout reduced from 4 > 0.
Maypul,1.4.14,Fspecial ledge snap threshold increased from 13px > 20px.
Maypul,1.4.14,Aerial Fspecial dash speed increased from 12 > 14.
Maypul,1.4.14,Uspecial speed boost when holding left or right after rising increased from 2 > 3.
Maypul,1.4.14,Aerial Dspecial’s endlag can now be cancelled into Fspecial.
Maypul,1.4.14 - Hotix,Aerial Dspecial can no longer be cancelled into Fspecial after being parried.
Maypul,1.4.14 - Hotix,Fspecial that starts on the ground but ends in the air will now have the shorter endlag that aerial Fspecial usually has. This makes sure that Maypul’s momentum is conserved like a normal aerial Fspecial.
Maypul,1.4.15,"Uspecial hit 1 now moves opponents while in hitpause, but only if their hurtbox will not be hit by the 2nd hitbox (shouldn’t affect normal usage of the move, but should make it still connect when hitting extended hurtboxes)."
Maypul,1.4.17,Holding the dodge button during Up Special’s startup will prevent Maypul from tethering.
Maypul,1.4.20,Vertically moving seeds will no longer be destroyed when touching Lily unless she is idle.
Maypul,1.4.20 - Hotfix,Further ground collision was added to seeds for when they touch the ground beneath Lily. This ensures it is destroyed in situations where Lily woud have previously removed it.
Maypul,1.4.21,"Lily will no longer try to attack enemies whose hurtboxes aren’t touching her (unless they’re invincible, in which case she will activate the same as previous versions)."
Maypul,1.4.21,Lily can no longer eat a seed on the frame it is created (this prevents Lily from eating seeds that would otherwise mark a player between Maypul and Lily).
Maypul,1.4.21,Hitting players immediately after they’re wrapped by Lily will no longer result in no knockback.
Maypul,1.4.21,Parrying will no longer remove Maypul’s mark if the Maypul is on the same team as the parrying player. This also applies to Clairen’s Dspecial.
Maypul,1.4.22,Jab 2 no longer goes into parry stun.
Maypul,1.4.22,Jab 2 can now be canceled into jab/tilts even on whiff.
Maypul,1.4.25,"Fair base knockback decreased from 6 > 5.5; knockback scaling increased from 0.5 > 0.65
Dan: This change is to allow Maypul to close stocks with Fair more reliably when her opponent is above 100% while not changing the combo flow of Fair below 100% too much."
Maypul,1.4.25,"Uspecial can now break projectiles.
Dan: Some Uspecials like the start of Zetter's cannot destroy projectiles intentionally. Maypul’s Uppercut had this property but since the hitbox is only above her and not blocking the front of her body, she doesn't need it"
Maypul,2.0.7.0,Dash attack hit 1 active frames: 4 > 6. Reduces the inactive frames between the hits.
Maypul,2.0.7.0,Lily can no longer be bashed while she’s stunned.
Maypul,2.0.8.0,"Changed position Dattack 1 pushes enemies in hitpause, 60 -> 50."
Maypul,2.0.8.0,"Bair Hit 2’s height increased, 50 -> 65."
Maypul,2.0.8.0 - Hotfix,The position Dattack 1 pushes enemies to now scales from 60 to 50 based on how late it hits.
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Finisher Bomb countdown increased, 30 -> 50. Spamming a massive kill move was never the intention of the finisher. A longer fuse means Mollo players will need to set up for the big reward."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Finisher Bomb reduced weight, 1.25x -> 1.6x. For reference, other bombs take 1.8x base knockback."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Adjusted explosion VFX layers of Finisher Bomb to primarily appear behind players. This allows players to see where they are in relation to the explosion, helping with reactionary DI."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Bug Fix: Finisher Bomb now puts Mollo in parry stun on successful parry.
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Increased Flashbang damage, 0% -> 5%. This bomb should not have been dealing 0% in the first place but it was particularly noticeable when Mollo could use it to stall off stage."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Bug Fix: Fixed flashbangs not applying full hitpause to attacking players.
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Default bomb hitpause increased, 6 + 0 -> 8 + 1.0. Default bombs were killing light characters a bit too early off the top. Peeling off some base knockback allows us to reduce those surprise KOs while still keeping it a KO option at high percents."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Primed bombs now properly explode in Mollo’s hand when hitstun ends.
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Held bombs will now continue their timer when Mollo is in hitstun. Mollo should feel more powerful with a bomb in hand but also at risk. Due to some bugs and timing, this goal was muddy at launch."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Bombs will not bonk players in hitstun moving faster than 6 pixels per frame. It was a frustrating experience to land a KO attack on Mollo only to have an errant bomb bonk him and negate all the knockback. 
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Bug Fix: Bombs that explode on bonk should now assign the hitboxes to the last player that hit it, and not just the Mollo that made it. (Meaning bonking a mollo with their own bomb should properly blow them up.) "
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Reduced bonk hitpause, 12 -> 7. Bonks had enough hitpause to lock opponents in place for too long. This was especially problematic getting hit by a bomb whose fuse was running low causing a likely KO with a finisher bomb."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Down Special now causes bomb detonations 1 frame earlier. Bat hits shouldn’t be overridden by bomb explosions anymore.

Mollo,2.1.1.0,"Bug Fix: Down strong's center hitbox hitpause increased, 5 + 0.5 -> 10 + 0.5"
Mollo,2.1.1.0,"For rapid jab, repeated attack inputs should keep spraypainting more reliably."
Mollo,2.1.1.0,Removed hitpause scaling on rapid jab to prevent stunlocking (was at 0.6x previously).

Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Flashbang hitstun multiplier reduced, 1.0 > 0.8 "
Mollo,2.1.2.0,Adjusted flashbang sprite to more clearly define it from a firecracker.
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Default bomb KB angle, 70 > 80. Default bombs were a bit too difficult to DI based on their position relative to the player. A higher angle makes bad DI less likely to KO off the top, but also makes follow-up combos from Mollo easier in the process."
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Adjusted explosion hit FX layers of Finisher Bomb to primarily appear behind players. This adds to a change last patch that allows players to see where they are in relation to the explosion, helping with DI on reaction."
Mollo,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Removed jab whifflag.
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Jab 1 recovery, 8 > 12"

Mollo,2.1.2.0,Down tilt BKB 6 > 7
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Dash attack bombless endlag increased, 15 > 18. The bombless Dash Attack is meant to push opponents off of Mollo rather than a strong combo tool. The extra endlag will still allow for some pressure with more strict follow-ups."

Mollo,2.1.2.0,Forward strong hits 1 and 2 are no longer techable on the ground (can still be wall teched).
Mollo,2.1.2.0,Removed the extinguish move; nspecial now does nothing when holding a bomb. Mollo’s ability to extinguish the bomb ran counter to our goal of making the bomb pull a commitment.
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Down strong's wide hitbox height increased, 58 > 60."
Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Down strong's wide hitbox Y increased, -30 > -28. "

Mollo,2.1.2.0,"Waveland time reduced, 9 > 8"
Mollo,2.1.2.1 - Hotfix,"Super armor now armors through Mollo's flashbang, but will be put into the same amount of hitpause as the flashbang normally does."
Mollo,2.1.2.1 - Hotfix,Fixed Ori bashing a bomb while it's still in Mollo's hand.
Mollo,2.1.2.1 - Hotfix,"Adjusted how Mollo bombs blow up in his hand. (The fuse does not tick down during hitpause if it triggers this way, so moves that modify hitpause afterwards like Bash don't desync the bomb's timer.)"
Mollo,2.1.2.1 - Hotfix,Fixed Ori being able to be bonked by a bomb they just bashed.
Mollo,2.1.2.1 - Hotfix,Fixed bashed bomb ownership; Ori should be safe from bashed bombs while Mollo will be hit by them.
Mollo,2.1.2.2 - Hotfix,Fixed bombs pushing out of terrain in the wrong direction.
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Reduced Neutral special’s break hitbox size, 284 x 284 -> 270 x 270. This should remove scenarios where someone gets crystalized while barely touching the field."
Olympia,2.1.1.0,Nspecial’s projectile now resets its despawn timer when parried. A parried projectile will now reach the Olympia that threw it.
Olympia,2.1.1.0,Crystalized sprite is now bi-colored.
Olympia,2.1.1.0,Forward Special now includes the gauntlet as the hurtbox.
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Forward Special’s hitbox moved inwards, 12 -> 6"
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Forward Special’s endlag is now 28 to 36 frames, depending on charge – was 20 to 36. "
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Reduced the amount Forward Special can push up when hitting a ledge, 40 -> 32 pixels. Olympia will still get a boost onto stage, but now it won’t be so much that it’s visually jarring when she pops up onto the ground when hitting the wall."
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Uair landing lag increased, 5 -> 8"
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Uair endlag increased, 7 -> 10"
Olympia,2.1.1.0,"Uair 2’s base knockback increased, 6 -> 7 "

Olympia,2.1.1.1 - Hotfix,Olympia's Forward Special jump cancel now works with tap jump.
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Hurtboxes now include the gauntlets on all attacks. Originally we wanted her reinforced armored hand to avoid having hurtboxes on them, but based on her archetype, she does not need the added disjoint."

Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Reduced back air underside hitbox active time, 11 > 6"
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Adjusted back air window timings so active time is 14 > 6 and endlag is 2 > 10. This means whifflag will apply more to the move.
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Reduced back air main hitbox width, 70 > 60"
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Reduced back air underside hitbox size and position. 
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Forward Strong is now split between an early strong hit lasting 3 frames, and a late hit beginning on frame 4. The early hit is unchanged from the previous version and the late hit has 12 base hitpause and 0.8 KB scaling."
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Neutral Special projectile hitstun multiplier reduced, 1.0 > 0.5. The projectile throw itself is not intended to be her main strength on Neutral Special. This puts the projectile portion more in line with other projectiles of similar knockback."
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Creating the neutral special gem (either automatically or manually) now puts Break Nspecial on 10 frames of cooldown. 
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Bashed neutral special gem is now destroyed when it hits the ground.

Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Up special pratfall landing time increased, 11 > 18"
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Down special dodge cancel in the air now puts the move on cooldown until you land, walljump, or get hit. Limiting the cancel to once per airtime will make the option a calculated choice rather than a repeated optimal strategy."
Olympia,2.1.2.0,"Increased early attack startup, 2 > 10. Releasing the move early was able to sneak through certain multi-hits, this should make the move lose to multi-hit attacks while keeping it as a good counter to single-hit attacks."
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Fixed down special armor being reapplied when releasing it.
Olympia,2.1.2.0,Bug Fix: Fixed down special armor being reapplied when releasing it.

Orcane,0.0.12,Hitstun increased on Jab 1 and Jab 2.
Orcane,0.12.2,"You can no longer create puddles inside jumpthrough platforms on the very edge. While the extra tech was cool, the reward was too great. We don’t want to require Orcane players to attempt glitched puddles when the positioning required was extremely tight."
Orcane,0.13.0,Forward Special Air Recovery reduced from 7 > 3. (Still goes into Pratfall after).
Orcane,0.13.0,Forward Special Grounded Recovey increased from 7 > 10.
Orcane,0.13.0,Forward Strong recovery increased from 18 > 20.
Orcane,0.13.0,Down Strong recovery increased from 18 > 22.

Orcane,0.13.0,Down Strong Puddle Whiff Recovery of 26 added. (16 base).
Orcane,0.13.0,Down Tilt Active Frames increased from 2 > 3. This is because timing down tilt on a falling opponent who is going to tech can be overly difficult.

Orcane,0.14.1,Uspecial sweetspot knockback scaling 1.4 > 1.2.
Orcane,0.14.1,Using Up Special as a parry punish is just too strong compared to other parry punishes especially against floaties.
Orcane,0.15.0,"All of Orcane's aerials autocancel on the last 5 frames of the attack except for the following: 
Orcane Uair: 8 frames of landing lag"
Orcane,0.15.0,"Whiff lag removed on everything but dash attack
Dtilt: 6 endlag, 12 whiff > 9 endlag
Dsmash: 12, 22 > 20
Fsmash_pud: 20, 30 > 26
Usmash_pud: 26, 36 > 30

Dattack: unchanged"
Orcane,0.15.0,Dash/Run speed 6.75 > 7

Orcane,0.15.0,Both Fstrongs hitbox moved up 1 pixel to match animation
Orcane,0.15.0,Dstrong knockback scaling 1.3 > 1.2
Orcane,0.15.0,Being interrupted during Dspecial no longer causes the puddle to stop spewing bubbles
Orcane,0.15.0,Using Uspecial removes your double jump. This means you can no longer double jump after Orcahop (instant Uspecial after double jump)
Orcane,0.15.1,Orcane Fstrong Knockback Scaling 1 > 1.05
Orcane,0.15.2,Jab 1 and Jab 3 hitbox and visuals increased to be closer in size to earlier builds.
Orcane,0.15.2,"The first 5 frames of Dash Attack roll off the ledge, buffering immediately into an aerial"
Orcane,0.15.2,"Fair knockback scaling is now based on Orcane's horizontal speed. If the speed is below 5, scaling is 0.5. If the speed is above 10, scaling is 1. Between 5 and 10, the scaling increases linearly from 0.5 to 1."

Orcane,0.15.6,Orcane Forward Air both landing lag and recovery reduced from 11/17 to 10/15 to reduce the impact on using Forward Air as a recovery option.
Orcane,0.15.8,Orcane Jab Combo has received a polish update to increase the frame count.
Orcane,0.15.8,"Orcane strong attack base knockback decays slightly over time. These should weaken the extended hitboxes at lower percents but they retain the same scaling so even late hitboxes will KO well at high percents:
-Ustrong: 10 > 8
-Fstrong: 7 > 5
-Dstrong: 7 > 6"
Orcane,0.15.9,"Forward Special (non-puddled) now has a smaller hitbox, making it harder for opponents to cover/punish multiple distances with a single parry, but also harder for Orcane to hit with. "

Orcane,1.4.14,Dspecial cooldown between dropping the puddle and spawning bubbles reduced from 60 > 30.
Orcane,1.4.14,"Uspecial now has a minimum speed boost on startup. Orcahop is exactly the same, but using Uspecial without upward momentum is much better."
Orcane,1.4.17,Forward Air animation cleaned up.
Orcane,1.4.17,"Up Special no longer takes Orcane’s double jump. Orcahop, however, still takes his double jump."

SK,1.4.9,Shovel Knight Uspecial landing windows is no longer immune to pratfall after a pillar breaks under them.
SK,1.4.9,Elliana's steam clouds no longer produce a small explosion effect when hit - Shovel Knight can no longer bounce off steam clouds with Dair by clanking with the hitboxes
SK,1.4.10,Dynamo charge is now lost when hit by Orcane's bubbles.

SK,1.4.25,"Fair hitpause increased from 4 > 6.

SK,1.4.25,"Dair non-spike sweetspot base knockback decreased from 7 > 6.
Dan: While we enjoy Shovel Knight being a monster offstage, we want to make sure his options are varied and aren’t just one attack. This change is to peel a little bit of power away from the sweetspot."
SK,1.4.25,"Dair non-spike sweetspot base hitpause increased from 8 > 10.

SK,1.4.25,"Dair spike hitbox hitpause scaling increased from 0.8 > 1.2.

Sylvanos,1.4.1,"Nair (Grass) - Landing Lag on whiff increased 6 > 8

Dan: Fspecial is an incredibly strong burst movement option and does so much for Sylvanos on hit. We needed to make it worse on whiff."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,"Fspecial can now cancel off of enemy flowers, Kragg’s rock, Shovel Knight’s rock, Kragg’s pillar, and Ranno’s bubble.
Dan: Now Sylvanos can hit more objects and fly around the stage! This change should help reduce the amount of times you are whiffing an Fspecial in certain matchups."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,"Grass now dies following the cooldown state after using Dspecial.
Dan: This is another big change. We want Sylvanos to be the stage control Rival. He is all about his turf. But we do want him to have to work to get the stage in his favor."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,"Grass cooldown state duration decreased from 5 seconds > 3 seconds.
Dan: Because the grass now goes away, we can shorten the cooldown state so players can start reapplying faster than they would have been able to."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,"Bug Fix: All grass is removed on death, including grass that is on cooldown."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,"Bug Fix: When Team Attack is off, teammates can no longer attack your flowers."
Sylvanos,1.4.25,Bug Fix: Corrected some attacks that spawned the wrong particles on hit.
Sylvanos,2.0.7.0,Uair 1 angle flipper removed. This makes Uair link better when hitting with the back side of the attack while moving slightly forward.
Sylvanos,2.0.7.0,Uair 2 damage: 3 > 5 (Total move damage: 6 > 8).
Sylvanos,2.0.7.0,Double jump and airdodge are restored 1 frame earlier when emerging with Uspecial.
Sylvanos,2.0.8.0,Dstrong Hitpause scaling: 0 > 0.7.

Wrastor,0.0.7,Neutral Air: Damage increased from 4 to 5.
Wrastor,0.0.7,"Up Air: Damage increased from 6, 6 sour to 7, 6 sour."
Wrastor,0.0.7,Down Special Visual Update.
Wrastor,0.0.8,Fstrong and Ustrong End Lag increased from 21 > 33. The Landing Lag on both attacks now scales with the amount of time left on his aerial recovery instead of being a flat number. This removes the ability to charge the Strong attack to remove landing lag.
Wrastor,0.0.8,Down Tilt hitbox has been reduced to match the visual.
Wrastor,0.0.8,Wrastor’s Knockback Factor reduced from 1.2 > 1.15. He was a bit too high compared to the rest of the cast which affects when he is KOed and how hard it is to combo him.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Forward Tilt Recovery reduced from 12 > 10. Whiff Recovery of 16 added.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Double Jump Height increased from 7 > 8. This allows him to follow DI and air dodges a bit more reliably.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Tornado (Neutral Special) minimum time decreased from 52 > 42. Maximum Time decreased from 72 > 62. This is to reduce the reliance on mid damage KO’s from Tornado.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Neutral Air Knockback 7 Base .5 Scaling > 5 Base .7 Scaling. This is to make the attack combo a bit better at lower percents while giving Wrastor a better option for getting opponents off stage at higher percents.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Slip Stream’s Projectile (Side Special) now causes the Flinch State against grounded opponents. Its hitstun on aerial opponents has been increased from .1x normal to .5x normal.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Down Special movement speed while in his current reduced from 15 > 12. Non-current is 10 for context.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Wrastor no longer has extended roll distance while inside his current.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Wrastor can no longer jump during Down Strong Charge frames.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Fstrong Sour Hitbox Size reduced to match the visual.
Wrastor,0.0.10,Up Special Sweet Spot Knockback Base decreased from 10 > 9. Scaling remains at 1.1.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Nspecial will no longer rise faster while hitting an opponent.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Nspecial final hit reduced from 7 Base .4 Scaling > 4 Base .7 Scaling. This is to remove ridiculously early KOs from Tornado but keep it a viable KO option at higher percents.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Forward Special pops up grounded opponents again. Hitstun returned to .1x. Buffer is cleared to prevent accidental air dodges.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Parrying Wrastor’s Forward Special now correctly removes the current and prevents Wrastor from using his Forward Special again for the full cooldown instead of .5x like it was before.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Fstrong Base knockback reduced from 9 > 8.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Ustrong Base knockback reduced from 9 > 8.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Air Acceleration while in Prat Fall reduced from .5x to .3x.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Fast Fall speed reduced from 12 > 11.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Bug Fix: Wrastor’s Aerial Down Special will no longer hit and slide near the end of it.
Wrastor,0.0.12,Bug Fix: Wrastor will now correctly go into Parry Lag when parried during Down Special and then hitting the ground after the kick but during recovery.
Wrastor,0.12.2,Down Special will no longer trigger its flip if Forward Special hits a rock while Down Special is active.
Wrastor,0.13.0,Horizontal Movement during Neutral Special reduced to 75% of air speed.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Nair landing lag 16 > 8.
Wrastor,0.14.0,"Whiff landing lag added to Fair, Bair, and Dair."
Wrastor,0.14.0,Nspecial SDI modifier x1 > x2.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Nspecial horizontal acceleration and speed reduced from .75x normal to .65x normal.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Nspecial Final hit knockback scaling reduced from .7 to .55.
Wrastor,0.14.0,"Nspecial min time 42 > 40, max time 62 > 60."
Wrastor,0.14.0,Fspecial recovery 7 > 11.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Sourspot Fstrong base knockback 5 > 6.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Extended parry lag on strong attacks (extends parry lag to ~57 frames usually).
Wrastor,0.14.0,Dair hurtbox extended to reduce disjoint.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Prat land time 14 > 24.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Uspecial sweetspot scaling 1.1 > 1.25.
Wrastor,0.14.0,"Bair knockback scaling .6 > .8, active frames 10 > 2 (turned into a sweetspot)."
Wrastor,0.14.0,"Second hitbox added to bair with the same knockback and active frames of the previous bair, but a smaller hitbox."
Wrastor,0.14.0,Wrastor can jump-cancel his tilts immediately after the last hitbox hits instead of only during the recovery frames (makes a 2-3 frame difference). This is because Wrastor has jump cancelled tilts as part of his design but they never felt impactful due to the late cancel opportunities. The recovery on each tilt was increased to balance out the risk of each.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Wrastor Ftilt Whiff Lag increased from 16 > 18.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Wrastor Dtilt Recovery increased from 12 > 14.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Wrastor Utilt Recovery increased from 12 > 14.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Wrastor Uair now has a center hitbox that deals 6 damage and knocks very slightly higher than the other hitboxes.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Parrying Dspecial will no longer send him forward.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Hitting with the last frame of Wrastor Dspecial will no longer cause him to fall to the ground instead of doing a backflip.
Wrastor,0.14.0,Bug Fix: Fixed hurtbox for Dstrong.
Wrastor,0.14.1,Hurtboxes expanded on Fair and Uair
Wrastor,0.14.1,Uair center hurtbox base knockback 8 > 6

Wrastor,0.14.1,Uair center hurtbox damage 6 > 5
Wrastor,0.14.1,Dair knockback angle 75 > 40. Now always knocks inward instead of always backward
Wrastor,0.14.1,Bug Fix: Sound effects fixed for Dair
Wrastor,0.14.1,Bug Fix: Controller vibration now stops when killing with the multihit part of tornado
Wrastor,0.14.1,Bug Fix: Flag is no longer invisible when the game is paused

Wrastor,0.15.0,"Whiff lag removed on everything but dash attacks
Wrastor ftilt: 10 recovery, 18 whiff > 13 recovery"
Wrastor,0.15.0,Run speed outside of current 4.75 > 5.5
Wrastor,0.15.0,Double jump speed decays with each jump (8 > 7 > 6 instead of 8 for all jumps)
Wrastor,0.15.0,Jab startup 5 > 3
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dtilt recovery frames 14 > 16
Wrastor,0.15.0,Ftilt recovery frames 13 > 18
Wrastor,0.15.0,Ftilt hurtbox extended to be less disjointed
Wrastor,0.15.0,Ftilt can only be jump-cancelled if the final hit connects
Wrastor,0.15.0,Uair startup 7 > 8
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fair startup 7 > 8
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fair recovery 8 > 10 (short hop double fair is still possible but is more strict in timing)
Wrastor,0.15.0,The tip of Fair now sends more outward and has less knockback scaling
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dair knockback angle 140 > 130
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dair semi-spike knockback scaling .6 > .75
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dair semi-spike hitstun modifier .8 > 1.0
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dair semi-spike hitbox moved up 15 pixels to match animation better
Wrastor,0.15.0,Dstrong can no longer be jump cancelled after being parried
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fspecial cooldown 360 > 480
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fspecial now causes flinch on grounded enemies
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fspecial recovery 7 > 10
Wrastor,0.15.0,Fspecial spawn point moved backward so it won't go through opponents when standing next to them
Wrastor,0.15.0,Nspecial SDI multiplier x2 > x1
Wrastor,0.15.1,Wrastor Up Special can now break stationary rocks.
Wrastor,0.15.2,Jab 1 startup increased from 3 to 4 frames.
Wrastor,0.15.2,Down Special restores Wrastor’s double jumps. This is to give Wrastor more reward for landing an aerial down special mid combo.
Wrastor,0.15.2,Down Special is now ledge cancellable.
Wrastor,0.15.2,Forward Tilt active window reduced from 18 to 12 frames.
Wrastor,0.15.2,New Sound Effect when landing Up Special sweet spot.
Wrastor,0.15.2,Nair base knockback now gradually decreases during its active frames. (5 > 2)
Wrastor,0.15.3,Bug Fix: Fixed Wrastor Ftilt jump cancel.
Wrastor,0.15.3,"Wrastor uspecial base hitpause 8 > 10, hitpause scaling .5 > .75."
Wrastor,0.15.4,Wrastor hitstun gravity increased from 0.4 to 0.45. His knockback modifier also was increased from 1.15 to 1.2. This makes Wrastor able to be comboed better while keeping his death percents about the same.
Wrastor,0.15.5,Hit Cancelling mechanic added.
Wrastor,0.15.5,Up Strong sourspot knockback scaling 1.2 > 1.15
Wrastor,0.15.5,"Up Special sourspot scaling (.75, .6) > (.5, .5)"
Wrastor,0.15.5,Prat land time 24 > 30
Wrastor,0.15.5,Wrastor airdodge speed multiplier in current 1.5x > 1.35x
Wrastor,0.15.5,Wrastor Uair and Fstrong angle flippers removed (the individual hitboxes can no longer reverse hit)
Wrastor,0.15.7,Prat Land Time reverted from 30 back to 24. The nerf was to make whiffing Up Special more punishing but made recovering on Wrastor a real frustration for new players.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Prat Fall Horizontal Accel reduced from .3 > .25 to make ledge cancelling Up Special a little bit harder.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Up Special sweet spot scaling 1.25 > 1.15. Strip power off his parry punish so we can distribute it to the rest of his kit.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Forward Special Angle on aerial opponents back to 90 degrees instead of 50. Still flinches grounded opponents. This make Forward Special more of an option mid combo to add some variety to his combo game for Wrastor players who want to hold onto it.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Up Tilt has a new spike hitbox at the bottom of his foot. Leads to followups if the opponent is on the ground and can spike opponents if they are offstage. Gives Wrastor a new parry punish at lower percents that allows for follow ups if you read DI.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Up Tilt now has a semi sweet at the top of the axe kick swing that has the old KO power while it has a large sour spot inside the kick. This is to prevent players from being rewarded with powerful hits when missing the sweet spot attack.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Minimum Down Strong Speed increased from 12 > 14. Maximum Down Strong Speed 20 > 21. Down Strong is hardly used except to edge guard players.
Wrastor,0.15.7,Up Special Animation Update.
Wrastor,0.15.9,Ustrong sourspot base knockback decreased from 7 > 6
Wrastor,0.15.10,Wrastor Tornado ASDI Modifier 1.0 > .8 to make it back to old ASDI values.

Wrastor,1.1.2,Utilt can no longer reverse
Wrastor,1.2.0,"Air Friction increased from .04 > .05.
Wrastor dies very early so this gives him a little help in making him very slightly harder to KO horizontally."
Wrastor,1.2.0,Increased the size of Dstrong hitbox from 30×40 > 50×50
Wrastor,1.2.0,Fair strong hit damage has been increased from 6 > 7. Weak hit damage stays 5.

Wrastor,1.2.0,Nair damage increased from 5 > 6.
Wrastor,1.2.0,Jab 2 Damage: 4 > 5.
Wrastor,1.2.0,"Kragg’s rock is no longer destroyed by Etalus uair, Wrastor Dair hit 1, or Forsburn cape. These moves now interact with the rock by moving it instead of outright breaking it."
Wrastor,1.2.6,Gameboy Wrastor slipstream is now translucent.
Wrastor,1.3.0,Wrastor is now actionable 5 frames later on dash attack in the air (only on whiff).
Wrastor,1.3.0,"Nair is now a 3 hit multihit move. The first two hits behave like Orcane’s dair, while the last hit is the same as Wrastor’s old nair."
Wrastor,1.3.0,Ustrong sweetspot knockback scaling decreased from 1.45 > 1.35.
Wrastor,1.3.0,"Nspecial  active frames per hitbox have been increased from 3 > 7.
Now the hitboxes appear every 8 frames with only a single frame between active hitboxes. This also means the very first hitbox comes out 2 frames faster than before."
Wrastor,1.3.0,"Nspecial final hit damage increased from 1 > 3.
The hitbox timing cleanup changed the damage from 11 > 9, so the final hit does more to compensate and keep the total damage the same."
Wrastor,1.3.2,Dspecial now only restores Wrastor’s jumps on hit instead of always.
Wrastor,1.3.3,Wrastor Aerial Dspecial hurtbox corrected.
Wrastor,1.3.4,Wrastor Nair has been changed to a 3 part multi-hit move. The first 2 hits will send downwards and the third hit is the same as the current Nair.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Down Air semi-spike hitbox angle flipper removed.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Forward Special no longer interrupts attacks.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Forward Tilt hitboxes adjusted in size and position. These first two hitboxes now additionally pull inward to make connecting the third hit more reliable.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Neutral Special disjoint removed.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Neutral Special hit lockout no longer applies to the final hitboxes of the move. This fixes a bug where they would miss due to the last multihit hitboxes hitting late.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Down Strong will now bounce if connecting on the frame before landing.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Down Special changed into a two-hit attack (to prevent it from heavily winning trades).
Wrastor,1.4.0,Up Special sweetspot angle flipper removed.
Wrastor,1.4.0,Prat fall air acceleration multiplier increased from 0.25 to 0.5.
Wrastor,1.4.1,Forward Special can now interrupt attacks again.
Wrastor,1.4.1,Wrastor Fspecial now deals no hitpause/hitstun against crouching opponents. It also has a new sound effect on frame 1 to make it more reactable.
Wrastor,1.4.1,Prat Land time after Neutral Special reduced from 24 > 18. Prat Land time after Up Special remains at 24.
Wrastor,1.4.2,"Up Air angle flipper changed from 0 > 6. This makes it so that the move always sends left if your opponent is on the left side of you, and vice versa."
Wrastor,1.4.2,Wrastor’s roll framedata normalized to [3 – 14 – 12] from [3 – 15 – 16].
Wrastor,1.4.2,Bugfix: Dying now restores Wrastor’s ability to charge a strong attack.
Wrastor,1.4.3,Fspecial now applies a cooldown on startup (half the duration of the normal cooldown). This means you are able to interrupt slipstream to prevent Wrastor from reattempting throwing it for 240 frames.
Wrastor,1.4.9,Tilts can no longer be jump cancelled after being parried (required hitting another player/object at the same time as getting parried).
Wrastor,1.4.9,Dash Attack will now go into parry stun correctly if it ends in the air.
Wrastor,1.4.9,Wrastor’s neutral air has been redesigned to be a 2 hit move. The first hit sends at a low angle with low hitstun. The second hit lingers for a while and has relatively strong knockback that decays drastically over time.
Wrastor,1.4.9,"Fspecial can now be destroyed by attacks. The slipstream is also destroyed and the move goes on 50% of its normal cooldown (for reference, parrying Fspecial puts it on 75% of its normal cooldown)."
Wrastor,1.4.9,Fspecial cooldown now applied 1 frame earlier (prevents Wrastor from getting the half-cooldown if interrupted on the frame that the projectile comes out).
Wrastor,1.4.9,Fspecial cooldown icon added to the bottom HUD.
Wrastor,1.4.9,Grounded Dspecial endlag on whiff: 21 > 28.
Wrastor,1.4.9,Uspecial last few frames of hurtbox fixed.
Wrastor,1.4.9,Pratfall aerial drift acceleration: .5 > .4.

Wrastor,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Dash attack hurtbox fixed
Wrastor,1.4.10 - Hotfix,Linking hits of Nspecial will no longer produce the purple kill effect.

Wrastor,1.4.14,Fstrong hitboxes moved to match the visual.
Wrastor,1.4.14,Fstrong sweetspot size increased from 10×10 > 12×12. This makes sure the sourspot doesn’t reach farther forward than the sweetspot.

Wrastor,1.4.15,Slipstream height reduced from 44px > 40px.
Wrastor,1.4.17,"Down Tilt endlag increased from 18 > 24 on whiff. It’s still jump-cancellable on hit, so the on-hit endlag is unchanged."
Wrastor,1.4.17,Up Strong sweetspot knockback decreased from 8 + 1.35 > 7 + 1.25.
Wrastor,1.4.17,Forward Special slipstream duration decreased from 8 seconds > 5 seconds.
Wrastor,1.4.17,"Forward Special slipstream cooldowns all normalized to 5 seconds (was previously 8 seconds normally, 6 seconds on parry, and 4 seconds when the projectile was hit)."
Wrastor,1.4.17 - Hotfix,Up Strong sourspot knockback decreased from 6 + 1.15 > 6 + 1.0. (Was listed in original patch notes but change did not go live until 48 hours later)
Wrastor,1.4.21,Ftilt hits 1 and 2 angle flipper adjusted from 4 (Horizontal knockback sends toward the center of the hitbox) > 9 (Sends toward the center of the hitbox).
Wrastor,1.4.21,Ftilt hits 1 and 2 are now untechable.
Wrastor,1.4.21,Nair animation updated.
Wrastor,1.4.21,Nair hit 2 hitstun modifier decreased from x1.0 > x0.8.

Wrastor,1.4.22,Nspecial no longer goes into the landing state when it ends on the ground.
Wrastor,1.4.22,Nspecial endlag increased from 16 > 20. This makes up for the 4 frames of landing that were removed.

Wrastor,1.4.24,Ustrong no longer has upper-chest invincibility on startup.
Wrastor,1.4.25,"Nair endlag increased from 8 > 12 on hit (12 > 18 on whiff).
Dan: With how floaty Wrastor is, he was able to whiff a Nair off stage and still be in a good position to intercept a recovery with a different option."
Wrastor,1.4.25,"Ustrong hurtbox now includes Wrastor’s head.
Dan: Wrastor Ustrong was a little too disjointed when missing his head from both the startup and especially the charged frames. Now you can hit him in the head!"
Wrastor,1.4.25,"Bug Fix: Ustrong sweetspot moved slightly to match the art (1px forward, 3px down)."
Wrastor,1.4.25,Bug Fix: Uspecial sweetspot visual moved slightly to match the hitbox (6px forward).
Wrastor,2.0.7.0,Nair endlag decreased from 12 > 10 on hit (18 > 15 on whiff). This is halfway between the pre-1.4.25 value and the post-1.4.25 value.

Zetterburn,0.0.8,Forward Strong Knockback: 8 Base .6 Scaling > 8 Base .7 Scaling.

Zetterburn,0.0.8,Forward Tilt Startup increased from 7 > 8 Frames. Wavedash forward tilt is a real terror thanks to the surprising range this attack has. We are bringing the startup in line with the reward.
Zetterburn,0.0.8,Up Special Travel Hitbox Knockback Scaling reduced from .6 to .5. It kills an edgeguarding opponent a bit too early. Does not feel great to die across the screen when missing an edgeguard on Zetterburn.

Zetterburn,0.13.0,Up Special Angles increased from 12 > 24. This gives Zetterburn mains more control during Up Special.
Zetterburn,0.13.0,Nspecial Charged Knockback changed from Base 7 Scaling .65 > Base 5 Scaling .8. This prevents the move from KOing as early while keeping it a solid option at high percents.

Zetterburn,0.14.0,Charged Nspecial can be jump-cancelled again.
Zetterburn,0.14.0,Charged Nspecial now has the same knockback as uncharged Nspecial. This is because charged Nspecial didn’t feel like an earned KO nor was it particularly fun to play against. Instead we are making it safe again but lowering its effectiveness at high percents.
Zetterburn,0.14.0,Charged Nspecial damage 8 > 10 (weaker hit 6 > 8).
Zetterburn,0.14.0,Nspecial charge time 40 > 35.
Zetterburn,0.14.0,Whifflag on Ustrong 0 > 30 (normally 20 endlag).

Zetterburn,1.4.13,Uspecial’s multihits can no longer cause the purple kill effect.
Zetterburn,1.4.14,"Dspecial cancel can now drift during the initial flip if Zetterburn’s horizontal speed is low enough. This allows you to gain speed after momentum is killed by hitting a wall, but does not affect normal Dspecial cancel."
Zetterburn,1.4.20,"If Fspecial’s fireball hits an opponent after you start a strong attack, it will no longer activate the fire-consume hitbox on whiff."

Zetterburn,1.4.22,Uspecial final hit final base knockback increased from 5 > 6.
Zetterburn,1.4.24,"Fstrong and Dstrong fire consume hitboxes angle adjusted from 361 > 45. It already used angle 45 almost all of the time due to the hitpause movement from the normal 2nd hit of both attacks, so this essentially removes a few unpredictable edge cases."

Zetterburn,1.4.25,"Uspecial final hit now has angle flipper 10 which is a new angle flipper that sends in the direction the player is moving.
Dan: This change is to remove janky and accidental KOs with Uspecial and also remove super safe KOs when near the edges."
Zetterburn,2.0.7.0,Charged Nspecial knockback scaling: .4 > .3. The buff from last patch ended up being a bit stronger than we intended.
Zetterburn,2.0.7.0,"Uspecial multihits angle flipper: 1 > 2. Since the spacing of the final hit no longer matters as much, the multihits now pull inward for more consistent linking."
Zetterburn,2.0.8.0,Uair now has an added sourspot on his hands.
Zetterburn,2.0.8.0,Uair Sourspot Angle: 75 -> 70.
Zetterburn,2.0.8.0,Uair Sweetspot KB: 10+0.6 -> 8+0.825.
